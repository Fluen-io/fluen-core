## Elements

### Class

#### `CrossReferenceResolver`

**Scope:** global

**Purpose:** Resolves and manages cross-references between documentation elements.

**Documentation:**

The CrossReferenceResolver class holds the logic for building a map of references, resolving them within content, and generating reference graphs.

#### `Reference`

**Scope:** global

**Purpose:** Represents a reference to a documentation element.

**Documentation:**

This dataclass models a reference to an element in the documentation by storing its source and target filenames, name, type, and line number.

### Method

#### `__init__`

**Scope:** CrossReferenceResolver

**Purpose:** Initializes the CrossReferenceResolver with a given manifest.

**Documentation:**

Constructor for the CrossReferenceResolver class. Sets up the manifest, logger, and builds the reference map.

#### `_add_reference`

**Scope:** CrossReferenceResolver

**Purpose:** Adds a reference to the internal reference map.

**Documentation:**

Helper method to add a given documentation element as a reference to the reference map, including necessary details.

#### `_build_reference_map`

**Scope:** CrossReferenceResolver

**Purpose:** Builds a map of all referenceable elements in the documentation.

**Documentation:**

This private method constructs the reference map by iterating through the project manifest&#39;s files and their exposures and elements.

#### `_find_best_reference`

**Scope:** CrossReferenceResolver

**Purpose:** Determines the best reference to use from a list of possible references.

**Documentation:**

Private method to find the most appropriate reference for an element, preferring those within the current file.

#### `generate_reference_graph`

**Scope:** CrossReferenceResolver

**Purpose:** Generates a graph representing dependencies between files based on references.

**Documentation:**

Returns a dictionary representing a graph where keys are file paths and values are sets of file paths they depend on.

#### `get_incoming_references`

**Scope:** CrossReferenceResolver

**Purpose:** Retrieves all references pointing to elements in a specified file.

**Documentation:**

Returns a dictionary of names mapped to lists of References that point to elements within the specified file path.

#### `get_outgoing_references`

**Scope:** CrossReferenceResolver

**Purpose:** Retrieves all references originating from the specified file.

**Documentation:**

Returns a dictionary of names mapped to lists of References that originate from elements within the specified file path and list their dependencies.

#### `resolve_references`

**Scope:** CrossReferenceResolver

**Purpose:** Resolves references in the given content string and returns the modified content.

**Documentation:**

This public method replaces reference placeholders in the content with appropriate hyperlinks and returns any unresolved references.

## Public API

- `LLMConfig` (exposure)
- `FluenConfig` (exposure)
- `FluenConfig.load` (exposure)
- `FluenConfig.create_default` (exposure)
- `FluenConfig.ensure_directories` (exposure)

## Dependencies

- `dataclasses` (external)
- `pathlib` (external)
- `typing` (external)
- `yaml` (external)
- `os` (external)

## Elements

### Class

#### `FluenConfig`

**Scope:** global

**Purpose:** Manages application configurations, specifically for settings related to directory paths and LLM configurations.

**Documentation:**

A dataclass that stores configuration details regarding output, cache, and temporary directories, as well as the default export type. It also includes methods to load configurations from a YAML file and ensure required directories exist.

#### `LLMConfig`

**Scope:** global

**Purpose:** Holds configuration for the large language model provider and its parameters.

**Documentation:**

A dataclass representing the configuration settings for a language model provider, including provider name, API key, model type, API base URL, max retries, and timeout settings.

### Method

#### `FluenConfig.create_default`

**Scope:** class method

**Purpose:** Creates a default configuration and saves it to a file.

**Documentation:**

A class method that generates a default configuration for the application using standard settings. This method saves the default configuration in a YAML file at the specified path and ensures all parent directories are created.

#### `FluenConfig.ensure_directories`

**Scope:** instance method

**Purpose:** Ensures that all necessary directories exist.

**Documentation:**

Ensures that the output, cache, and temporary directories are created in the file system if they do not already exist. This prevents runtime errors related to missing directories.

#### `FluenConfig.load`

**Scope:** class method

**Purpose:** Loads configurations from a specified YAML file.

**Documentation:**

A class method that attempts to load a configuration from the given file path. If the specified YAML file does not exist, it creates a default configuration instead. Parses YAML content into corresponding configuration objects.
